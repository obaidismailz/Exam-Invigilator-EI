# Exam Invigilator

This project aims to proctor tests/exams in the exam halls by monitoring suspicious activities of
the candidates through cameras. Based on the gestures of the candidates in the exam hall, the
proposed system will detect suspicious actions using computer vision and image processing (cv2
, OpenCV , python module) techniques and machine learning algorithms. The proposed system
will then notify the supervision team about any suspicious activity in the exam hall. The proposed
system will also record the suspicious activities as proof for the invigilator.
The proposed system will detect cheating based on actions performed by the candidates, like Back
Watching, Front watching, Showing Gestures, Side Watching, Talking to Someone,
Sharing/Exchanging Answer Script, Copying from Notes, Carrying a Smartphone, Walking in the
Exam Hall, and Crowding. It will also identify the right candidates in the exam hall by processing
their faces and then marking their attendance. And if anything suspicious happens in the exam hall,
this tool will notify the proctoring team through some beep and/or notification.
The final product will be a software-based tool incorporating a livestream from the camera,
monitoring the studentâ€™s activities in the exam hall, and generating a notification when something
goes wrong.
